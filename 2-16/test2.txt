On Thursday evening, about 80 people involved in theater, live music, mini-theaters and other entertainment businesses stood silently in front of the Prime Minister’s Office, holding signs that read, “Culture and arts are necessary to live.”

The demonstration was organized by We Need Culture, a group of people who have come together from various industries amid the pandemic. The group is calling strongly for financial aid and other support for artistic activities.

Under the current state of emergency, which started on April 25, the government has made such requests as asking theaters to hold performances without audience members, and asking movie theaters with a floor area of more than 1,000 square meters to close.

As the state of emergency, which was initially planned to end Tuesday, will be extended until May 31, the government decided to ease some of the restrictions for theaters and certain other facilities. However, the states of emergency imposed so far have weighed heavily on entertainment businesses.

Loft Project is a company that operates live music venues mainly in Tokyo. When the third state of emergency was declared, company President Umezo Kato decided to operate the venues until 8 p.m., serving food but suspending the provision of alcoholic beverages.

The venues are open with their seating capacity reduced by half.

“Sales are now 30% of what they were before the pandemic,” said Kato, 54. “Live music venues are not just space for rent, they are places that create culture. We hope these venues will be recognized as cultural facilities and provided with support to stay in operation.”
